How to run
1. The video file you want to edit, rename it to "video.avi" and keep it in the same folder.
2. run the code.
3. Red color will be replaced by the background.
4. Edited video will be saved in the same directory.

What is happening in the code?
1. We keep a frame in the starting of the video as the background.
2. When the frame with red color ie. color within the limits set in the code occurs, the part is replaced by the background.
3. The replacement can be done for any color by changing the color limits in the code.
